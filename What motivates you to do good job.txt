There are three things which motivate me.
1. First is my parents who are working hard to see me in a good position and independent.
2. The second one is my goals which motivates me to do hard work to achieve them.
3. Third one As I belong to a middle-class family, I have faced many difficulties during my journey. So, I want to make things better now. This motivates me always.
