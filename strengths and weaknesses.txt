I am a "good listener" and a "disciplined" person.
I believe that one of my strengths are "patience" since it's necessary to tolerate people, as we all are different we have to "listen attentively" and "respect" opinion of others.


Weaknesses
- Can't say no to people asking for help.
- I find it very difficult to say 'NO'. Sometimes it puts me in a tough situation.
